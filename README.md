# Calculator-for-complex-numbers
here is the free access for the calculator code of complex numbers 
I make a linkedlist class and another class of name complex.
Where different functions are written for specific function like addition , subtraction,multiplication, division. 
We include this two classes into separate header files. Also include the header file of main.cpp.
Happy coding.
